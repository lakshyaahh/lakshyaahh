# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Lakshya**, an aspiring AI engineer based in India.

I design, break, fix, and build whatever I can imagine — mostly with Python.  
If an idea hits my brain at 2AM, chances are I’ll code it out anyway.

My current tech stack is **Python**, **Flask**, and slowly leveling up in **AI/ML basics**.  
Right now I’m building a **smart calculator**, a **Flask-based platform**, and small practice projects to sharpen my skills.

I build beginner-friendly projects to learn real software skills — calculators, Flask apps, and early ML experiments.  
Always improving. Always shipping.

🚀 Current goals  
- Learn Python deeply  
- Build solid AI-ready foundations  
- Create portfolio-ready projects  

📬 Open to collabs & internship opportunities.

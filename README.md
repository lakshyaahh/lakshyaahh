# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Lakshya**, an aspiring AI engineer based in India.

I design, break, fix, and build whatever I can imagine — mostly with Python.  
If an idea hits my brain at 2AM, chances are I’ll code it out anyway.

My current tech stack is Python, Next.js & AI Developer | Building LLM-powered agents (Note Taker, Code Generator) and voice platforms (AI Mock Interview). Actively focused on full-stack development, Gemini API integration, and streamlining deployment with Vercel. 🚀

I build beginner-friendly projects to learn real software skills and early ML experiments.  
Always improving. Always shipping.

🚀 Current goals  
- Learn Python deeply  
- Build solid AI-ready foundations  
- Create portfolio-ready projects  

Open to collabs & internship opportunities.

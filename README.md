# Hey there! 

I’m **Lakshya**, an aspiring AI engineer based in India.

I design, break, fix, and build whatever I can imagine — mostly with Python.  
If an idea hits my brain at 2AM, chances are I’ll code it out anyway.

I build beginner-friendly projects to learn real software skills and early ML experiments.  
Always improving. Always shipping.

Open to collabs & internship opportunities(2026-2027)
